# Attack Strategy
The attack strategies adopted by us are similar to those adopted in real-world hackers and security-oriented papers.
We show the evidences below:

* **Attacks from real-world hackers:**<br>

1. [17 reported DDoS attacks towards Bitfinex](https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/92134801/ImpactofDDoSAttacksonCryptocurrencyExchange.pdf)

2. [DDoS attack targeted at Bitcoin](http://www.revistaespacios.com/a20v41n03/20410329.htm) 

3. [DDoS attacks on Ethereum attack-net](https://twitter.com/JonnyRhea/status/1286810750896541698?s=20)

4. [Sybil attacks on Monero](https://coingeek.com/monero-was-sybil-attacked) 

* **Attacks in security-oriented papers:**<br>

5. [Simulated DDoS attacks on blockchain, via bandwidth depletion and transaction flooding](https://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1219&context=ism)
